                <p>An armed conflict forces the young couple Pedro and Alma Madrigal to flee their home village in Colombia with their infant triplets, Julieta, 
                    Pepa, and Bruno. Pedro is killed during their escape, but the candle Alma is carrying gains a magical power, repelling the attackers and 
                    creating Casita, a sentient house located in a magical realm bordered by mountains. Fifty years later, the village thrives under 
                    the candle's protection, which grants "gifts" to each Madrigal descendant when they turn five, enabling them to serve the villagers. 
                    However, ten years ago, Bruno, who was scapegoated for his ability to foresee troubling events, disappeared. Julieta's youngest daughter, 
                    15-year-old Mirabel, inexplicably did not receive a gift, leaving her feeling like an outsider in her extraordinary family.</p>

                <p>On his fifth birthday, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, is granted the ability to communicate with animals. During the celebration, the other Madrigals 
                    unintentionally exclude Mirabel from the family photo. Mirabel notices cracks forming in Casita and the candle's flame flickering. She tries to warn 
                    her family, but Casita temporarily repairs itself, causing the Madrigals to dismiss her concerns. After overhearing Alma's prayers, Mirabel decides to 
                    save Casitaâ€™s magic herself. She talks to her sister Luisa, who, despite her superhuman strength, confesses she feels overwhelmed and that her gift has 
                    been faltering. Luisa suggests that the secret behind the fading magic might be in Bruno's room, a forbidden tower in Casita.</p>
