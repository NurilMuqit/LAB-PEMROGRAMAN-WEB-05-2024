                    <p>She is a first-year student who has a weak constitution and is often absent from school. She is a Spirit World Warrior with the ability to manipulate her blood, which is unique even among Spirit World Warriors. She is a member of the Literary Club and is the last surviving member of her clan, the Kuriyama bloodline.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Introverted, clumsy, and with an awkward personality, Mirai rarely stands out in school. In fact, she struggles in life; she has to earn her own money to make ends meet, but her constant fear of actually encountering a Youmu used to prevent her from earning an income by slaying Youmu, which most Spirit World Warriors take on as part of their profession. To make things worse, her hobby of writing blog articles about her much-beloved bonsai-trees is often ridiculed on the internet. Her movements in battle demonstrate a certain degree of fighting knowledge, although she lacks actual combat experience due to her issues with Youmu encounters. After bonding with those around her, Mirai begins to feel more confident about defeating Youmu and becomes an experienced Spirit World Warrior.</p>
                <p>She is fond of saying the words "How unpleasant!" (不愉快です！, "Fuyukai desu!") when agitated. Mirai has been shown to be very bad at lying, as the other characters in the show (mainly Akihito Kanbara) immediately notice she subconsciously cleans her glasses while avoiding eye contact whenever she's telling a lie. Mirai has a similar personality as a Dandere, with a little bits of Tsundere. She is also awkward, even though she doesn't mean to be, and has a tendency to be withdrawn; often staying in the background despite having a voice of her own. She's also self-conscious about her looks, such as when Ai and Mitsuki were talking about how having big breasts was troublesome. Mirai tries to avoid interacting with others but fails. She is also very persistent and doesn't like being ridiculed.</p>
