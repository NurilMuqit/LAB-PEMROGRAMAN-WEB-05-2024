                    <h3>Mikasa's Description</h3>
                    <p align="justify">ㅤㅤMikasa Ackerman is one of the main characters in the anime and manga series Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), 
                        created by Hajime Isayama. She is a member of the Scout Regiment and is known for her incredible strength, combat skills, and deep loyalty to Eren Yeager, the protagonist of the series. </p> 
                    <p align="justify">ㅤㅤMikasa is often portrayed as calm, stoic, and composed, especially in high-pressure situations.
                        She rarely shows emotion except when it comes to her close friends, particularly Eren. Her loyalty to Eren stems from the fact that he saved her during a traumatic event in her childhood, 
                        and ever since then, she has felt deeply protective of him.</p>
